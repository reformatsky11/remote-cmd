== About ==
-----
This application will take a single command equivalent of `ssh {host} {command}`
*or* it will take a file containing a list of commands to run on the remote host.

this should replace the need for rexec.
By using libssh2 only one connection is made to the host, then multiple commands are sent in serial.
By default the script suppresses stdout, this keeps the bandwidth requirements low, and should run nicely on slow connections.
-----

==Supported authentication==
   * RSA, DSA and RSA1(identity) key 
   * password
